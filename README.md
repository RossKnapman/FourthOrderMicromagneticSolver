# Fourth-Order Micromagnetic Solver

This is a micromagnetic solver which evolves the system with next-nearest-neighbour exchange, using a dimensionless form of the LLG equation, such that the single parameter to modify is the externally-applied magnetic field.

It is by no means polished or even guaranteed to work; I only made it public so that I can easily share the code with collaborators who do not use GitHub.
